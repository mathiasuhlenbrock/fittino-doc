TreeCalculator
==============

The ``TreeCalculator`` comes into play when Fittino data should be reprocessed. For that, the
``TreeCalculator`` simply loops over the entries of the ROOT tree stored in the specified file.

The options of the ``TreeCalculator`` are:

``InputFileName``

   The name of the input file.

``InputTreeName``

   The name of the input tree.
