Samplers
========

As the name suggests, ``Samplers`` are supposed to sample, that is to write out, points of the
parameter space in a distinguished manner. The main difficulty each efficient sampling algorithm is
faced with is to write out relatively more points in the interesting region while covering the whole
parameter space at the same time.
