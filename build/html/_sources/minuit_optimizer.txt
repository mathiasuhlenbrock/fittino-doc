MinuitOptimizer
===============

The ``MinuitOpitmizer`` is merely a wrapper around the ``Minuit2`` classes shipped with the ROOT
data analysis framework. It is taken 'as is' and no further configuration options are supported by
Fittino at the moment. For more information on ``Minuit2``, please have a look at the corresponding
`documentation website <https://root.cern.ch/root/html604/MATH_MINUIT2_Index.html>`_.
