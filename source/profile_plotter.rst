ProfilePlotter
==============

The ``ProfilePlotter`` is intended to produce nice displays of the :math:`\chi^2` value in
dependence of a single quantity, e.g. a model parameter. These kind of plots are very important and
often looked upon, because they provide valuable information about the location and the width of the
minima in the :math:`\chi^2` space. There are currently no additional configuration options needed
for ``ProfilePlotter``.
