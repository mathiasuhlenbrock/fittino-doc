Input files
===========

The functionality of Fittino is controlled using an XML input file whose path is passed to the
program as a parameter. In the input file the user can specify the model to be analyzed and the tool
the model should be analyzed with. An example for a complete input file can be found in the
:ref:`getting-started` section. In addition, a number of annotated example input files can be found
in the ``input/`` directory.
