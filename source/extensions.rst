Writing your own extension
==========================

To help you getting started with writing your own extension as quickly as possible there exist a
number of template files in the devel directory. At the moment only templates for Fittino optimizers
exist. If there is no template available yet for the extension you intend to write use the generic
FittinoClassTemplate files.

If you decided to use a template, replace the name of the file and the placeholders in the file with
the name of your class, insert your name and email adress to the preamble and add a brief
description on what your new class is intended to do.
